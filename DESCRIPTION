Description: This package is a group of functions used in infectious diseases analysis.
	It implements an algorithm to calculate relative transmission probabilities between
	cases in an infectious disease outbreak or cluster using naive Bayes. It also
	contians various functions to use these probabilities to estimate
    transmission paramaters such as the serial interval and reproductive number
	and visualize the results.
